# The "We Don't Give a Flying F***" License (WDGAFF-1.0)

Copyright (c) 2024 Pillaites Dev Team (aka Sleep-Deprived Pillai College Hackers)

## Preamble

By using, copying, modifying, or distributing this software, you agree to be bound by the terms of this license. If you do not agree, well, tough luck - use something else.

## Terms and Conditions

1. **You can do whatever the hell you want with this software**, as long as you:
   a) Don't blame us when it inevitably breaks
   b) Don't come crying to us when it destroys your social life
   c) Don't pretend you actually wrote this code (we know you didn't, and so does your impostor syndrome)

2. **Warranties and Liability**:
   This software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and noninfringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software. In simpler terms: if this breaks your stuff, you get to keep both pieces.

3. **Distribution**:
   You are free to distribute this software to others, but only if you include this license and warn them that it might be hazardous to their mental health and social standing.

4. **Modifications**:
   You can modify this software. In fact, we encourage it - it can't get any worse, right? Just don't try to pass it off as the original. We've suffered enough.

5. **Commercial Use**:
   Feel free to use this commercially. If you actually make money from this, please seek professional help - and maybe share some with the broke college students who created it.

6. **Patent Use**:
   This license provides no patent rights. If you want to patent this, you might want to reconsider your life choices.

7. **Termination**:
   This license automatically terminates if you violate any of these terms. It also terminates if you stare at it for too long, because, let's face it, you've got better things to do.

8. **Contributions**:
   Any contributions you make to this project will be under the same ridiculous license. We're all in this mess together.

## Conclusion

By using Pillaites, you acknowledge that you've read this license, understood it, and have decided to use the software anyway. We admire your courage (or question your sanity).

Remember: with great power comes great responsibility. We've given you the power; the responsibility is your problem now.
