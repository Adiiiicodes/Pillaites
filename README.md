# 👁️ Pillaites: The Social Media App That'll Make You Question Your Life Choices 📸

Welcome to Pillaites, the unholy offspring of despair and the collective madness of Pillai College students. This monstrosity was conceived during a caffeine-fueled hackathon where sleep was optional, and sanity was left at the door.

## 🚽 Features That'll Make You Want to Flush Your Phone

- **Filters So Bad, They'll Make Your Face Look Like a Nuclear Accident** 🍄
  Remember, beauty is in the eye of the beholder... if the beholder is legally blind.

- **Stories That Disappear Faster Than Your Will to Live** ⏳
  Share your mundane life for a whopping 24 hours before it vanishes into the void, just like your dreams.

- **DMs That Are About as Private as a Public Restroom** 🚻
  Slide into those DMs! We promise* your messages are secure (*we crossed our fingers).

- **An Explore Page That's More Addictive Than Your Crippling Coffee Habit** ☕
  Say goodbye to productivity and hello to endless scrolling through pictures of food you can't afford.
